# MixEffect SuperSource Preset Graphics

Photoshop template files for use with MixEffect SuperSource Presets.

The exported preset icons from MixEffect are generally representative of the size and position of the boxes, but they are not pixel precise. These Photoshop templates can be used to create overlays and lower thirds that are pixel-perfect.

You can export these graphics as transparent PNGs and import them into your ATEM switcher using ATEM Software Control. Next, you can use the Downstream Keyer to overlay these graphics on top of your SuperSource presets. Watch the video here for an example: https://youtu.be/AcFzf2_0Nzc
